# Text Summarization and Graph-Based Relationship Extraction

##  Overview
This project takes an input text file, summarizes its content, extracts relationships between key entities, and visualizes the summarized information as a graph. It utilizes **NLTK for natural language processing** and **NetworkX/Graphviz for visualization**.

##  Features
-  **Summarizes input text** using NLP techniques  
-  **Extracts key relationships** between entities  
-  **Constructs a graph-based representation** of the summary  
-  **Uses NLTK and NetworkX** for processing and visualization  

##  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `NLTK` (Natural Language Toolkit)  
  - `NetworkX` (Graph visualization)  
  - `Matplotlib`/`Graphviz` (Optional, for enhanced visualization)  

##  Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

##  Usage
1. **Place your input text file inside the data/ folder.**
2. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py

##  Project Workflow
- **Text Processing – Cleans and tokenizes text.**
- **Summarization – Extracts key information.**
- **Relationship Extraction – Identifies relationships between entities.**
- **Graph Construction – Represents extracted relationships visually.**
